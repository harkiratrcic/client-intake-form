# Vercel Production Environment Setup

## Critical Issue Identified

The "Form Not Found" error on production is caused by **missing or incorrect environment variables on Vercel**.

## Required Environment Variables on Vercel

### 1. DATABASE_URL (Required)
```
postgresql://postgres.[your-project-ref]:[your-password]@aws-0-[region].pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
```
- Get this from your Supabase dashboard
- Make sure it's using the **pooler connection** (port 6543) for serverless compatibility

### 2. NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL (CRITICAL - Currently Missing)
```
https://your-vercel-deployment.vercel.app
```
**This is the root cause of your issue!**

- Without this, the code defaults to `http://localhost:3000`
- Forms are created with URLs like `http://localhost:3000/f/{token}` (won't work in production)
- Form page tries to fetch from `http://localhost:3000/api/forms/{token}` (404 error)
- Set this to your actual Vercel domain

### 3. JWT_SECRET (Required)
```
your-super-secret-jwt-key-make-it-very-long-and-random-123456789
```
- Use a long random string (at least 32 characters)
- Generate with: `openssl rand -base64 32`

### 4. RESEND_API_KEY (Required for emails)
```
re_your_actual_api_key_here
```
- Get from https://resend.com/api-keys
- Without this, emails won't be sent
- Currently you have a placeholder key that only simulates sending

### 5. EMAIL_FROM (Required)
```
noreply@yourdomain.com
```
- Must be a domain you've verified in Resend
- Or use Resend's test domain

### 6. NODE_ENV (Auto-set by Vercel)
```
production
```
- Vercel sets this automatically
- Don't manually set this

## How to Set Environment Variables on Vercel

### Option 1: Via Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
4. Add each variable above
5. Make sure to select "Production", "Preview", and "Development" environments
6. Redeploy your application

### Option 2: Via Vercel CLI
```bash
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL production
vercel env add DATABASE_URL production
vercel env add JWT_SECRET production
vercel env add RESEND_API_KEY production
vercel env add EMAIL_FROM production
```

## Critical Code Locations Using These Variables

### Form Creation (app/api/forms/route.ts:82-83)
```typescript
const baseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL || 'http://localhost:3000';
const formUrl = `${baseUrl}/f/${result.instance.secureToken}`;
```
**Impact**: Without NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL, emails contain `http://localhost:3000/f/...` URLs

### Form Viewing (app/f/[token]/page.tsx:26)
```typescript
const baseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL || 'http://localhost:3000';
const formResponse = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/api/forms/${token}`, {
  cache: 'no-store',
});
```
**Impact**: Without NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL, page tries to fetch from localhost, causing "Form Not Found"

### Email Service (lib/services/email-service.ts:39-54)
```typescript
const apiKey = process.env.RESEND_API_KEY;
```
**Impact**: Without valid RESEND_API_KEY, emails aren't actually sent

## Verification Steps After Setting Variables

1. **Set all environment variables in Vercel dashboard**
2. **Redeploy the application** (or trigger a new deployment)
3. **Test health endpoint**: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/health`
4. **Test form creation**: Create a form through the dashboard
5. **Test form viewing**: Click the link in the email
6. **Check email**: Verify the email was received with correct URL

## Additional Improvements Needed

### Issue: Server Component Making HTTP Request to Own API
The form page (`app/f/[token]/page.tsx`) makes an HTTP fetch to its own API endpoint. This is inefficient and can cause issues.

**Better approach**: Import Prisma directly in the server component instead of fetching from the API.

### Issue: Email Configuration
If you want real emails to be sent:
1. Sign up at https://resend.com
2. Verify your domain OR use Resend's test domain
3. Get an API key
4. Add it to Vercel environment variables
5. Update EMAIL_FROM to match your verified domain

## Quick Fix Checklist

- [ ] Set NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL on Vercel to your production domain
- [ ] Set DATABASE_URL on Vercel (should already be set)
- [ ] Set JWT_SECRET on Vercel (should already be set)
- [ ] Set RESEND_API_KEY on Vercel for real email sending
- [ ] Set EMAIL_FROM on Vercel
- [ ] Redeploy the application
- [ ] Test form creation and viewing
- [ ] Check that emails have correct production URLs
